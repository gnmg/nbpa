                                soon, we found a snake in the jungle as it climbed up a small hill. The moment when the

                                Orangutans belong to the only genus of great apes native to Asia and are a critically
                                endangered species, with deforestation, palm oil plantations, and hunting posing a

                                During the Covid pendemic we had moved our base from the city to the country side as we
                                have our Native village in Gujarat where I use to regularly go for birding. Suddenly
                                some one bumped into me and said there is a huge colony of bats near my house but it
                                stinks.
                                I was in total awe looking at the size of the colony of these mouse tailed bats.
                                Actually this was not a cave but an abandoned old house where these little creatures
                                took refuge and somehow made their home as the ambiance was similar to a cave
                                including the darkness and temperature with no disturbances. Everybody was in confusion
                                looking at me shooting them day and night standing in 1 ft of bat guano that stank.
                                Perhaps the pandemic was wrongly blamed on them over human foolishness.

                                One-Horned Rhinos are an endengered animal and at the same time it is pride of Assam,
                                India. This shot was taken in the Burapahar range of Kaziranga National Park. Because it
                                was a rainy day, I was the only photographer in that zone, with my guide.
                                Because of heavy rain, I had to struggle, but I got some amazing moments. I
                                was really lucky to capture this moment. It was taken just after the rain. The color of
                                the habitat of this image impressed me the most and the jungle mynas give a special

                                Ijen is a volcano located on the border of Banyuwangi Regency and Bondowoso Regency,
                                East Java, Indonesia. This mountain has a height of 2,386 meters above sea level and is
                                located side by side with Mount Merapi. Mount Ijen last erupted in 1999, Climbing this
                                mountain can be started from two places, namely from Banyuwangi or from Bondowoso.
                                When I took this picture I hiked at dusk, starting at 15:00 Western Indonesia time to
                                wait for the sunset over Ijen Crater. The challenge I faced to get a clean sunset was
                                that thick fog often appears in the afternoon which could cover the crater. I was very
                                lucky after so many times of hiking to this crater I finally got the sky and the crater
                                bright enough for me to take pictures when the sun went down. Not only that but also in
                                the afternoon the smell of sulfur also becomes more intense. Ijen Crater is an acidic
                                crater lake located at the top of Mount Ijen with a lake depth of 200 meters and a
                                crater area of 5,466 hectares. Ijen crater lake is known to be the largest strong acid
                                lake in the world.</span>

                                Sunrise over the ancient city, Bagan. As an iconic place in Myanmar, Bagan is
                                an amazing ancient city, one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and also a famous place
                                in Asia. Bagan's Sunrise and Sunset times are so dramatic and peaceful. I captured this
                                photo one morning in winter (January). All over the views are so amazing
                                during this season for the seeing and for the feeling of Bagan's foggy landscaping. To
                                capture this photo, I climbed to the top of the one pagoda's early in the
                                morning before sunrise. I captured the photos by using tripod to get a slow shutter
                                speed
                                and Tele-Photo-Lens to focus on the sunrise with the historical temple's Foreground.
                                I also used a graduated neutral density filter to get a good balanced exposure of the
                                ground and sky. Nowadays in Bagan, it is not allowed to climb any
                                temples or
                                pagodas. So it is very difficult to see Bagan from a high viewpoint. </span>

                                brightest representatives in the northern part of the Sea of Japan. Its habitat also 
                                extends to the more northern seas - Okhotsk and Bering. And I am always glad when I
                                manage to see them. I was lucky to film the process of their matting. It was

                                Wobbegong sharks, also known as carpet sharks are found mainly around Australia and
                                Indonesia. The name ‘Wobbegong’ is believed to come from an Aboriginal language, meaning
                                ‘shaggy beard’, which describes its weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the shark’s jaw.
                                Wobbegong sharks are ambush predators and are often found hiding under rocks or corals.
                                This picture was taken in Raja Ampat, Indonesia at a depth of 35 meters. It was rare to
                                find a wobbegong resting completely out in the open on top of a perfect table coral.

                                surrounding the mushroom. I did not use a light and only used the light of the mushroom

                                going round my small garden in the morning, I noticed these two Hawk moth caterpillars
                                on a Desert Rose plant. These are Daphnis Nerii ( Nerium Oleander Moths ) moths and had
                                just
                                finished off all the leaves from Adenium obesum plant. Generally, they feed only on
                                Oleander plants but occasionally feed on Adenium obesum plants. Both the moth larvae are
                                in two different instars. The brown one indicates that it is soon going to pupate
                                underground and later emerge as a moth. That evening, I noticed that the brown one had
                                disappeared.</span>

                                August 2020 I visited Coochbehar, where there were bushes of these Ornamental Banana
                                (Musa
                                ornata) to click the photos of Sunbird sucking nectar from it.
                                Everything was going as usual but sudenly I was shocked that this crimson started taking
                                a bath
                                in the water stored in the banana flower petal from an early morning
                                drizzle. I was literally stunned to see this unusual behaviour of the bird. I kept my
                                camera's shutter button pressed as the bird took the bath. This was really a once in a
                                lifetime moment. It is amazing how nature can surprise us. In this image the bird was
                                frozen in action with it's head upside down while it was taking bath in the flower

                                Greater Crested Terns (Thalasseus bergii) are one of the migratory birds to Sri Lanka
                                and they habituate during mid-year on remote islands (Sandbanks) off the Palk Strait.
                                Despite an extremely difficult and tiring sea passage and terribly hot and humid
                                condition with zero shelter, I went on numerous occasions to capture their life and
                                habitat. Their behavior really portrays a unique natural history. “Nature
                                is so stunning” I believe. I used a drone to capture their habitat from a different
                                perspective.

                                distinctive hanging nests in close proximity to human structures. This family chose
                                Kranji Marshes (a wetland reserve in Singapore) to build their home. Using the
                                surrounding vegetation as a screen, I observed and photographed them with a telephoto
                                set-up. A higher shutter speed was used to freeze the frantic movement of the nestlings
                                during each feeding. Despite practicing nature photography for over 10 years, I continue
                                to be amazed by the beauty and tenacity of these amazing birds; and it is a privilege to
                                capture their behavior with my lens.

                                picture was taken during my birding trip to the Keoladeo Ghana bird sanctuary in the
                                state of Rajasthan, Northern India. We were observing and capturing these darters and
                                cormorants busy fishing in the large Mansarovar lake at the center of the park. These
                                birds have wettable plumage which helps them in their underwater fishing technique of
                                ambushing and stabbing their prey fish with the help of their pointed beak and long
                                snake-like neck. However, because of this wettable plumage they become temporarily
                                flightless after their long fishing sessions and need to dry their wings in the sunlight
                                and do proper preening of their feathers. This particular darter decided to take some
                                rest from his hour-long fishing activity and chose a branch close to us for drying its
                                feathers. I took full advantage of the perfect afternoon light and close proximity to
                                the bird and managed to get a sharp behavioral portrait of the darter, drying his
                                feathers and preening at the same time.

                                observing the behaviour of various species in nature. There are such varied and
                                sometimes really complex behaviors in nature. I always learn more every time I’m in the
                                wild. This is an example of why I re-visit the same location throughout the year as one
                                can observe behavior of different wildlife subjects. I went to Kapurthala where I often
                                travel on weekends with my father for bird photography. The rainy season had just
                                finished, I saw a few damselflies around and was observing them. Soon I saw a mating
                                pair of damselflies Coromandel Marsh Dart also known as Yellow Waxtail in a swampy area.
                                I saw them from a short distance, but it was difficult to capture them as they settled
                                on the vegetation. I had no other option but to get into the swamp. To get close to
                                these damselflies I had to wade through the swamp. It was the dense, tangled hostility
                                of the swamp and its enormous size that enabled hundreds, and perhaps thousands of small
                                world species to live here in freedom. I was almost thigh deep in muddy water when I saw
                                them settle in one place for a while. Their mating behavior exhibited a wheel shaped
                                appearance. They formed an interesting pattern when attached to one another. The male
                                continued to remain attached to the female, I got down at an eye level and captured this

                                With growing human-animal conflict and the changes we humans are doing by cutting down
                                the trees has affected millions of birds, mammals and other wildlife. I’m determined to
                                have people notice that we really need to give space to wildlife. It’s a sad thing that
                                many forests are now being converted to industrial towns in my state or are being
                                commercialized, it is really a sad and bad situation. I often travel to
                                Kapurthala city for birds photography on weekends, an area where there are still a few
                                birds in spite of industrialization. During this trip in winter season I was surprised
                                to see that Short Eared Owls were back in town again in spite of industrialization. They
                                come every winter to this place, and I was glad that they were back again this year. I
                                was with my father and I was watching this owl family from far away but soon one of the
                                owls he came straight to the tree guard which was close to us. He looked straight
                                towards me, I was surprised to see this owl at such a close distance. I captured this
                                moment when we were looking at each other eye to eye and I felt that this owl wanted to
                                say to me I C U boy !</span>

                                Throughout the year, I have been photographing wildlife in the Tohoku Kaido, the
                                southernmost point of the Far North, which is also my home. Photographers from around
                                the world focus on Hokkaido in winter, but the so-called "green" season from spring to
                                autumn also offers wonderful wildlife on a global level. It is possible to observe and
                                photograph the wonderful nature without being too far away from people's living areas.
                                It is important to convey this information to people. I believe that conveying this
                                information will lead to the enlightenment of the importance of nature and consideration
                                for wildlife.</span>

                                In 2019 a group of like-minded divers put together an itinerary to visit for 12 days the
                                amazing underwater sites of the Central Visayas in the Philippines to include such spots
                                as Dumaguete, Malapascua, Bohol, Cabilao, Balicasag, Cebu, Panglao, Moalboal and more.
                                The trip brought something new and exciting daily as we visited a number of very healthy
                                marine preserves that produced many colorful and unusual invertebrates, a very close
                                encounter with the graceful thresher shark, large shoals of fish, whales sharks, sea
                                turtles galore and stunning, healthy corals. This trip and the resulting video is a
                                testament to the marine protected areas that the Philippines has invested a lot of time
                                and education in to help preserve the reefs and sustain tourism. During these hard
                                times, we wish our hosts the best and hope visitors can soon return to see these ocean
                                wonders.</span>
