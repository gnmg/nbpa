                     because I’ve been enchanted by their expressive facial signals and peaceful behaviors. I’ve become famil-iar with this father and his young one because I’ve identified this young one by its right eye which became cloudy. I suppose
                     that the baby has no sight in his right eye. Whenever I come across them, the father seems to protect his baby in a gentle manner and his young one always follows its beloved father. This time I saw them while they were eating their
                     favorite leaves in the forest. Red-shanked douc is on the IUCN Red List as Endangered (EN). It can only be found in very limited areas in Southeast Asia. This natural habitat is highly critical for the continued existence of this
                     endangered species and needs to be protected from potential resort development projects.

                     and jumping every second. I have made several failed attempts to capture an image of a baby on its mother’s lap. After so many failed attempts when I heard the alarm call of a sambar deer suddenly the baby langur went straight to
                     it’s mothers lap and started suckling. I made no mistake in capturing it in the best possible way. A wait of almost one hour had paid off.Capturing emotion in the eyes of the mother and baby was a very difficult task in such low light

                     of Southeast Asia. I lived on a small house boat for about a week searching around the river. One morning two days before I had to leave I was talking to my guide and local rangers and one of them happened to mention that he had seen
                     an orangutan cross the river in another location a few months ago, I knew this was rare and a natural history moment if I could get this on camera especially since orangutans hate water. They gave us the location details and we got
                     there early the next morning hoping to find him. After two days of waiting around the same area one morning one of the rangers on night patrol came by and told us that he saw the orangutan on the opposite side of the river about 200
                     meters away from where I was and there could be a possibility of him crossing the river. I was very lucky to have seen this very rare event.

                     which assists it in cling-ing to branches, and one of its cone-shaped eyes. Chameleons can move their eyes separately and look in opposite directions simultaneously, which accords them a unique vision capacity. When a chameleon locates
                     its prey with one eye, it moves its head in the direction of its prey, directs both eyes, and then sees its exact location.

                     I call it “In Paradise”.

                     becomes the main sighseeing site in the Irkust region. The extraor-dinarily pure and transparent surface of the frozen lake makes it a landscape photographers paradise. For this photo, my friends and I encountered subzero temperatures.
                     Since it was snowing the night before, most of the lake was covered by snow however we managed to find an area with transparent ice on the surface where bubbles of methane gas can be seen below the surface of the frozen lake. I positioned
                     my camera at a low angle and pointed it up toward the rock, I managed to get a few shots as the sun rose above the lake casting its golden light upon the lake.</span>

                     they cover the ocean floor since there is a lack of rock shadows. I cropped this photo to show a beautiful alignment of shrimp.</span>

                     leisurely in the sea. I usually dive with a macro lens attached. The ocean had been very beautiful for the past few days and deep-sea fish and deep-sea creatures appeared due to up-welling so I expected to see something so I went
                     in to the ocean with a wide angle lens. On this day I was able to see many unique creatures that I can not usually see but the encounter with this jellyfish was especially interesting. A lot of small fish were around the jellyfish
                     and I took many photos of it. I was excited to cross paths with another chrysaora pacifica.</span>

                     spring when I was on one of my daily dives I met a pod of baby dolphins. My eyes met with the sweet eyes of a baby dolphin whose body was still white. It was as if its lovely eyes were inviting me into the sea.

                     much larger than I had expected. From the way they were swim-ming, it seems that they were not at all worried about the presence of humans. A group of mantas were spiraling up-ward and I was able to capture the mo-ment the leader
                     of the group reached the surface flipped his body over and dove back down. This photo truly expresses the mantas’ suppleness and strength.

                     build their nest with leaves. When a new nest is required, individual workers scout for suitable clusters of leaves, which they grab with their mandibles and attempt to draw together. When a number of leaves are stretched into position
                     for binding, each held in place by rows of workers joined by another set of workers as is depicted in the picture. As soon as all the leaves are brought together the process of stitching these leaves starts. The mature and experienced
                     workers capture white colored and transparent late instar larvae with quite delicacy in their mandibles and move them to and fro on the edges of the young tender leaves. In response to this movement or tingling feeling, the larvae
                     release sticky material from their glands and a white sheet of silk joins the leaves one by one. This behavioral characteristic of ‘stitching or weaving leaves’ for nest formation is unique among these ants, and the reason behind
                     their name ‘Weaver Ants’.

                     the value of taking a shot of a little beetle while rolling its dung ball, I have been looking for them whenever I visit places where they can be found. But I had to wait more than five years to see this type of action again. This
                     time it was in Yala National Park. This time I thought it’s time for me to take a low angle shot of it. The beetle was on a dung mountain which was on grass, I took a few shots while lying down on the ground, then he dragged the ball
                     on to the grass, but that was not the shot I was looking for. So while I was waiting on the ground the beetle dragged its dung ball on to a gravel surface.

                     like windshield wipers. They also drink water in a similar way. I clicked this image with the help of 50mm f/1.8 along with attaching a Voking 12mm extension tube.</span>

This photo of the baby heron was taken on Bubiyan Island, the largest island in the Kuwaiti coastal island chain situated in the north-western corner of the Arabian Gulf. It is a safe place for both animals and people alike. To reach the island you need to have government permission and has been an environmentally protected area for more than 27 years. When I got to the island I found some nests then lay down and moved around slowly while wearing my camouflage clothing.</span>

                     forests. These birds feed on fruit and occasionally on small insects. They build nests in tree holes by pecking and digging out the tree trunk. A pair will repeatedly communicate with each other in a call that sounds like repeating
                     ‘kutroo’. In this photograph a parent bird is seen about to enter the hole with a beak full of banyan fruit. In this case the nest was built about three meters above the ground. I set up an alumi-num ladder and tied the camera to
                     it yet I could not get close enough without scaring off the bird. The shutter was released from a distance using a remote shutter release. I waited nearly six hours to capture this shot. Weather conditions were fine, though it was
                     bright the sky was cloudy making the light softer. I am an amateur photographer. I have experi-ence in covering family events and social events of friends and relatives. After retirement I became interested in nature photography especially

                     to catch something and feed the chick. I stayed there for almost three hours and I was sweating all over because of the high temperature - it was about 49 degrees - so I waited and nothing happened then a breeze of air started to
                     hit the yellow grass. Then the chick stood up and started looking around. Because I was on the ground at eye level, this blur effect came out perfect.</span>

                     It was January, mid winter in Goa. Not that cold in this part of the world. Good season for birding and bird photography though. On one of my visits to this area, I kept observing that these parrots regularly visit the plant of powder-puff
                     flowers, in the morning and afternoon, almost everyday. These birds seem to love powder-puff flowers. So, one afternoon, I found a spot to sit and wait for them to arrive. Didn’t have my tripod with me unfortunately. So, I had to
                     make do hand-holding the big and heavy 500 f/4 lens. After a long wait, they finally showed up. Landing on the plant, they started feeding on the lovely pink flowers giving some opportunities to make a few images. I had to juggle
                     around with the ISO combinations to get a decent enough shutter-speed to hand hold. All the effort and the wait was absolutely worth it.

                     On the way while we were crossing the road I saw a spot-ted owlet flying and he went inside this tube. I asked my dad to stop the car, he stopped the car but didn’t believe me that the owl could go inside this tube. I looked at the
                     tube again for few minutes and I was surprised to see a pair of owlets coming out of the tube. I pointed my dad towards the tube and he was stunned seeing the owls over there. He rolled the car glass down for me and without wasting
                     anytime I got the shot of the owlet duo. They were looking straight into my eyes, I felt like each of the owlets wanted to say “I C U” boy! I was happy to see these beautiful spotted owlets in their urban home and I had to say goodbye
                     to them so that they could be on their own.</span>

                     looking for scenes that cap-ture the essence of diving for me, when I noticed this school of fish swimming with the current a bit further down the reef from me. I positioned myself in their path, and waited for the current to bring
                     them closer. I was hoping that they would swim around me and create a tunnel effect so I could take a photo. When they approached, I angled myself so that I would take up less space and aimed my camera directly into the school. I
                     was absolutely ecstatic when the wave broke into a tunnel, and swam around me. This photo was taken in the Malé atoll in the Maldives, which is one of the countries that is most threatened by rising sea levels (as a result of global
                     warming).

                     when I began my PADI Sea Turtle Identification specialization course. The course is geared towards the protection and conservation of sea turtles by taking photos of the side of a sea turtle’s face. This pattern is unique to an individual,
                     similar to how each person’s thumbprint is unique to them. By keeping track of all of the turtles in the reef, it is possible to know what turtles are unhealthy or at risk so they can take measures to protect them. During the dive,
                     we were supposed to swim close enough to a turtle to capture the pattern on their face, and record it for later. This photo shows the turtle’s face clearly and the health of the turtle can be assessed from the body. This photo was
                     taken in Malé atoll in the Maldives.</span>

                     word called “Lela”. It has a deep meaning to it but in simple terms it means “wind”. Any movement in nature can be called “Lela”. It is also the word to show this area’s peoples’ respect towards Ainu. People describe “Lela” as a “dance
                     in nature” since the wind creates a beautiful movement in nature such as when the flowers and leaves or even your hair moves when there is a breeze. This is “Lela”. The charming Ezo owl is a precious bird which lives in the village
                     throughout the year. The red-crowned crane, from which the village gets its name, has lived in the village for more than 10,000 years and is called “Sarolunkamui” in Ainu, meaning “god of the marsh.” For the theme of this video, I
                     focused on the beauty of the village in which I live and its irreplaceable nature.</span>

                     of the clear blue ocean dol-phins were appearing on all sides of me. When the dolphins and I would dive down at the same time they would look at me as if they were inviting me to come and play with them. I replied back to them by
                     making eye contact saying OK. They were free and playful. After having plenty of eye contact with them they started circling me. Every time I have the opportunity to swim with them they make me feel happy and fulfilled. This is the
                     reason I keep taking photos of and video taping dolphins. </span>

                     Turtles who come en-masse to nest adjacent to these coastal hamlets of Odisha, India. I had a dream to witness and photograph one of nature’s most extraordinary occurrences. I suc-ceeded this year. Arribada, the arrival, usually happens
                     at night as the turtles cannot tolerate intense light. I wasn’t able to take the clippings (videos) at night as the conservation rules imple-mented by the forest department didn’t allow the use of white beam of torches (flashlights).
                     The low red beam of the headlamp was the only permissible light source at night, so the arriving turtles won’t feel disturbed. I chose dusk and dawn to photograph to at least get the minimum light required. I found it toughest to
                     keep the focus sharp when the turtles were moving. I overcame this with a trick - of pre-focusing a wide zone initially and switching the focus to manual to avoid lens hunt and to shoot the clippings (video) handheld.</span>

                     able to see this amaz-ing incident, the battle of two small creatures to survive. One crab struggled to protect himself from these ants, but he could not do anything against these thousands of ants, finally he lost the battle. It
                     was afternoon in the month of February and was the beginning of summer. While walking through this forest stream, I saw a group of ants take the crab’s legs, at the same time the crab was running to save his own life but the ants
                     wanted to catch this crab and within seconds 500 to 600 ants were stuck to this crab like magnets and that moment its Battle of Survival started. While taking this video I was sitting on a small stone in the middle of stream and the
                     stone was covered with these ants, I knew if they bit me it would be very painful. I did not want to miss this activity but while I was taking the video three ants bit my leg and it was painful but I did not want to take my attention
                     away from what was hap-pening. After this incident I saw these ants kill four other crabs. A battle is going on day and night in nature, either to survive yourself or to kill others. </span>
