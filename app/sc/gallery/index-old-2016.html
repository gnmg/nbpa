                <p>In the middle of a slightly overcast spring day in Ubud on the island of Bali, I headed to the Monkey Forest, a tropical rainforest of densely growing bunyan trees. Within the forest, I found an enormous, even more magnificent tree that was viewed as sacred, and had countless long aerial roots hanging down. A macaque was playing in the roots, swinging around from one to the next like Tarzan. At one point it slipped and fell, and though it was extremely tricky with a handheld camera, I was able to follow it, and capture its fall from top to bottom. The photos were taken raw. </p>

                <p>Being nocturnal, it's rare for Siberian flying squirrels to be active during bright daytime hours in February in the middle of winter. In order to capture this rare opportunity, a great deal of time was spent searching for a location. The Siberian flying squirrel is small, and it glides very quickly, so catching one on camera is very difficult, but success was achieved here through a thorough understanding of the animal's movements, and determining a specific point to aim for in its flight. I feel that the animal's gliding motion and the surrounding area have been very gracefully captured in a single frame here.</p>

                <p>A beguilingly beautiful image of the spray from a waterfall and the masu salmon jumping within. Even when they're in pain or faced with difficult challenges, these fish never give up. Quitely and indifferently, they continue to jump. This is a message from wildlife. What you take from it may well vary based on not only your own sensitivities, but your very way of life. The space that the masu salmon jump through is like a world floating in a tiny cosmos. Within, one can find absolute beauty, amazement, and amusement. And within, there is even the courage not to give up.</p>

                <p>A brief drizzle provided respite to the floundering fish in a rapidly-drying waterhole in Kirinda, Sri Lanka. The relief though was short lived for this one particular fish that found itself in the jaws of a young crocodile (Crocodylus palustris). I had mounted my remote-controlled camera on a tripod, and was monitoring the scene for several days, waiting for the perfect natural moment. I particularly like the streaks of water that slant across the frame, the clearly visible diaphanous fins of the fish, the texture of the crocodiles scales and the overall wet gleam of the image.</p>

                <p>I was taking photos of orangutans in Bali, Indonesia, when it started to rain. Just before I put my camera away, I saw this orangutan take a taro leaf and put it on top on his head to protect himself from the rain! I immediately used my DSLR and telephoto lens to preserve this spontaneous magic moment.</p>

                <p>"Wishing to photograph this dreamlike moment, I spent a number of years calculating the necessary timing, and left the house at 1:00. However, due to an avalanche blocking all of the routes to the shoot site, I had to spend an hour and a half walking with winter mountain hiking gear, and wound up reaching the site at 6:30. I waited for my chance in the biting cold, and as soon as the moment that the sunlight stretched out across the scenery arrived, I began to carefully photograph the columns of light one by one as they appeared for a moment and then promptly disappeared, all the while crying out with excitement on the inside as I stood alone on the pure white plains.</p>
				<p>I photographed the scene for around an hour, and selected the best shot among the thirty that I took."</p>

              <div class="gallery__item__block_main__description">
				<p>“Pa-Ngam-Ngon” waterfall is a small waterfall located at “Khun Dan Prakan Chon Dam” within Nakhon-Nayok province, Thailand (northeast of Bangkok). The waterfall is surrounded by clear water from the dam, and lush, pristine rain forest. I have chosen the month of November to be the perfect time to capture this image, it is when the jungle and waterfall is most alive. The only way to reach the waterfall is by a 20 minute boat ride, departing from the dam’s ridge, then a hike through 700-800 meters of jungle terrain.</p>
				<p>The stunning waterfall flows down from a high cliff, initially I was stunned by the beauty of the waterfall and stood in bewilderment for a moment, absorbing my surroundings before I proceed to raise my camera and capture the moment. What I wanted to achieve in this image, is to capture the richness and abundances of the surrounding rainforest. I started scouring the area for the best angle, until I found a fallen tree trunk surrounded by moss and fern covered rocks, I then decided to use the fallen trunk and rocks as foreground and utilized the trunk as a line of sight to the waterfall.</p>
				<p>To capture the perfect image I waited for clouds to block out the sun to reduce lens flare, and continued to mount my DSLR full frame Cannon 6D on a tripod. I chose the EF 17-40 mm f/4L USM lens and 17 mm distance to capture the lushness of the surrounding jungle, I also utilize CPL filter to reduce light reflection on leaves and waterfall. I set my F-stop to f/16 to create a deep depth of field through-out the image. With the exposure time set at 8 seconds and ISO speed at 100, I was able to capture the flow of the waterfall while leaves and surroundings remain still. Due to a low light environment at the time this image was taken my camera lighting calculations are “off” which result in over exposure. I then chose to set the Exposure bias to -0.7 to counteract and find the balance between light and dark.</p>
				<p>Other than a lens hood on my camera, I also used my hand to block out any additional lens flare, and when the clouds drifts across the sun, a small breeze flowing through the lush jungle, I knew that this is my golden moment, then……Snap!</p>

                <p>A Wild Fox Chase - a journey in search of a fox. Foxes are known to be elusive creatures, but there was a certain hill where I always saw their footprints in the snow. As creatures who preyed on the wild mice to be found between the snow and the soil, it seems they knew that there were delicious mice to be found beneath the snow on the hill. I would wait patiently in front of the hill for them to appear. And on this day, one was kind enough to appear, walking along the ridgeline below the pale evening sky. The handful of footprints I had seen just might have been his.</p>

                <p>"Amidst the heavy snow, I found a still deserted Blue Pond. Reaching the spot for the shoot across the virgin snow, still devoid of footprints, a beautiful scene of white and blue appeared before my eyes.</p>
				<p>It was still the dim hours of the early morning, so I feel I've been able to better capture the blue of the pond here with time lapse photography. I thought it might be best to use a wide lens, but decided to be brave instead, and have strong memories of shooting with a telephoto lens and cutting it myself."</p>

                <p>Squid are very active at night. I enjoy watching squid wriggle their tentacles into slithering spirals while hovering, and thrust them straight out like a bouquet of tails to swim. Squid can darken and lighten their pigmentation at will, an ability which becomes obvious when they are illuminated by a night diver's light.</p>
				<p>This photo was taken in the Waigeo island of Raja Ampat, which is on the northwest tip of the Bird’s Head Peninsula of West Papua. Raja Ampat translates into English as Four Kings and gets its name from a local mythology about four kings that occupy the four big islands; Salawati, Batanta, Waigeo and Misool.</p>
				<p>It is easy to find squid in Raja Ampat. Squid generally hold in mid-water, especially active at night, looking up and down for prey.</p>
				<p>This squid was encountered at 5 meters depth and displayed its deadly fangs and claws trying to scare me. It is very difficult to focus in these conditions. I tried many shots, but this was the only successful one.</p>

                <p>At the end of a dive in Papua I noticed a jetty with local kids and fishing lines. Thinking there may be an opportunity for some images I jumped in again. There was a huge school of Ikan-Puri (Bait fish) hiding from predators under the Jetty. I know the image I wanted in my head so I adjusted the settings and then gently herded the fish with my strobe arms. They would make these amazing formations. I lie on my back and shot straight up into the sunlight.</p>

                <p>This picture was taken at Havelock Island, Andaman, India. Underwater photography has been my dream for 20 years. It was my first experience of underwater photography and in the first dive I used an underwater camera. It was a difficult task for me as lot of things troubled me during this dive including technical faults, physical stress, mental imbalance, strong currents and so on. Unlike wildlife photography, you don’t have to wait for a long period or sit in one place quietly so as not to disturb the subject. As you dive you find an ‘ocean full’ of subjects to shoot so you get confused and it is easy to waste time. Buoyancy control is very important in underwater photography and as I was a beginner it troubled me a lot but I was firm and had a passion for this so I gave it my best. Underwater panning photography is the most difficult type as shutter speed is slow and flash gets fired so photos get over exposed. In this photo all the fish are moving and only one of them is still. As I dived all of them started to swim near me so, I got scared and due to this I did not set the camera to the required setting and the photo resulted into a panning shot. </p>

                <p>When I found this nudibranch (Favorinus tsuruganus), it was lying on the rock inside the eggs. Tried a few "normal" shots and didn't like the effect. It then starting crawling around the eggs and then back to the wall and then back to the eggs slowly and I knew I wanted it standing right in the middle as if it was looking out of the window so I waited and waited and it finally walked to the exact position where I wanted it to be. I then adjusted my strobes on both ends of the eggs so the thick layer of eggs would block the lights out creating this dramatic effect.</p>

                <p>I wondered what these insects do at night so I entered the valley at night to see. As a result I saw a lot of sleeping insects. However this mantis was different. It seemed as if this mantis was playing a game with me. I was impressed so I rushed to take the photograph. In order to separate the mantis from the background I used two flashes. I later learned that mantis eyes turn black to collect light. This mantis taught me that there are interesting subjects in my area to photograph.</p>

                <p>I like to lie on the grass looking at nature photography objects because doing so lets me get close to nature which sometimes gives unexpected results. I saw a little mantis climb to the top of the leaf then look back at me. I was lying on the ground when I shot this mantis on the leaf against the sky. It's like it is standing on top of the world, which at the moment it was the king of the microscopic world.</p>

                <p>The Hooded Grasshopper (Teratodes monticollis) is a grasshopper with an elongated hood on its thorax.  is the main feature of these beautiful insects. They can be seen in green color during the monsoon and a dull brown color after the monsoons.</p>
				<p>I had visited Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Goa Forest in winter. It was November, but the weather was still cloudy. It was very difficult to find this Nymph Hooded Grasshopper amidst the tree leaves. It was d so well as a dry leaf. The color and texture of leaf was exactly the same as its body. The wing pods could be seen but the entire wings were not yet developed. Nymphs and adults of this species are green in color. Nymphs’ colors can be variable depending on environment, age, etc.</p>
				<p>Hooded grasshoppers feed on tree leaves. This species of grasshopper is distributed in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

                <p>We the Homo sapiens boast of our civilization and culture and in this pride we tend to forget, that there is this tiny kingdom of weaver ants which has a thriving colony which is full of life. They are predominant members of forest insect communities and found throughout the entire tropical world except America and belong to a relatively old genus Oecophylla in the subfamily Formicinae of hexapod order Hymenoptera with 11 fossil species reported from Oligocene and Miocene periods and two extant species; Oecophylla longinoda occurring widely across Afrotropical region and Oecophylla smaragdina is found in the Oriental, Palaearctic and Australian regions. Oecophylla smaragdina was diverged between 3.6 and 7.8 million years ago somewhere in China.</p>
				<p>These ants exhibit marvelous architecture and intelligence to build their nest with leaves. When a new nest is required, individual workers scout for suitable clusters of leaves, which they grab with their mandibles and attempt to draw together.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile other workers made their attention to the site and presumably by the success of the first workers and join the effort. To join the two leaves, ants form chains by holding each other’s waists and thus pull the leaves together as is depicted in the picture. In the image one ant is helping another in turning the leaf in suitable position so as to fit the requirement. The ants make their nests with the leaves of the tree sewn together. Subsequently a number of leaves were stretched in to position for binding, each held in place by rows of workers. As soon as all the leaves were brought together the process of stitching of these leaves commenced and the mature and experienced workers capture white colored and transparent late instar larvae with quite delicacy in their mandibles and move them to and fro on the edges of young tender leaves. In response to this movement or tingling feeling, the larvae release sticky material from their glands and a white sheet of silk joins the leaves one by one. This behavioral characteristic of ‘stitching or weaving leaves’ for nest formation is unique among these ants and the reason behind their name ‘Weaver Ants’.</p>

                <p>T G Halli (Tippagondanahalli) is a reservoir which used to supply water to Bangalore during 1980’s. Now due to reduction in catchment area and a disturbance to the flow of rainwater into the reservoir the water level has gone down. However fishing has continued and is a good place for bird watching as well. On a weekend bird watching trip, I noticed a pair of Brahminy Kites were busy fishing close to a fisherman’s boat. I parked my car close to the bank and set up my tripod and camera so that I was sitting in the shadow of the car so the bird didn’t get distracted with my presence. At once the bird skimmed the water and picked up a weed thinking it is food and after inspecting it dropped the weed back. I had managed to click this image while the Brahminy Kite was inspecting the weed during flight.</p>

                <p>I visit this place regularly. This is a sweet water lake and at the time of sunrise the water was very still and the wind was not blowing. Everyday River terns come here to hunt but this day the wind was not blowing. First this bird tried to catch the fish but failed it turned again to catch the prey so I got ready to shoot. You need to sacrifice your deep sleep, be at a higher elevation than the subject and 5 to 10 minutes before the sunrise at the location to get a perfect reflection picture. After getting this picture I tried for more 15 days to get a situation like this but Mother Nature did not cooperate. The challenge here was the low light; it’s difficult for action photography of birds. The location was 2 hours from my place. I used to wake up at 3 in the morning and travel for 2 hours and barely shoot for half and hour.</p>

                <p>The Tama River, which flows through Yamanashi prefecture, Shinagawa prefecture and the Tokyo metropolitan area has a number of areas whose banks are unprotected despite the river's status as one of the major rivers in the area surrounding the capital, and the river is thus rich in natural beauty, offering one the chance to see many wild birds and riverside plants. Many wild birds - mainly herons - fly by the weir at the river's midstream point, preying on fish trying to swim against the rapid currents. In the short space of time between the sky beginning to grow light and the dawn breaking, one can capture magical scenes of the water painted in a pale blue. Using a slow shutter, images were captured of the weir's egrets repeatedly over the course of a year.</p>

              <div class="gallery__item__block_main__description">
                <p>It was my 4th day in Bharatpur during last year’s winter and I was wondering if I could get the shot that I have been trying to get for the last two years. I was trying to get a shot with a darter spreading its wings with an orange sunset background. The darters or snakebirds are mainly tropical water birds and have long thin necks, which have a snake-like appearance. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location (generally a nearby tree) and spread their wings. I was positioned right where I could see the sun going down and there was a tree where Darters usually come to dry their wings. After waiting for 15-20 minutes, the sun was getting very low and there were no signs of any Darters. Suddenly I saw Darter coming out from water and sit on the lowest branch of the tree. The Darter was still not in line with sun and I was hoping that she would move up by 4-5 feet so that I could frame the correctly. After waiting for a few more seconds the Darter moved up and came to the top of the tree. But at the same time, the sun had already gone down and this was the best shot I could get. Getting such shots is always challenging as we have no controls over such situations and there is a lot of waiting involved.</p>

He was exhausted as birds migrate from Europe to Africa crossing Middle East which is more than 5000 Km. Vultures’ necks are very long but I had the chance to take a shot face to face while his neck was not appearing.</p>

                <p>Greater Flamingos are social birds, like all flamingos. Their flocks can be very large and numerous. The great number of flamingos residing in a single area leaves room for aggressive behaviour between the members of the flock. Sometimes Greater Flamingo males fight over nest grounds or mates. The males can use their bill to fight or they have been observed chasing each other in the wild. They have other mechanisms of protecting and threatening other small birds. Sometimes due to space reasons they bite each other to go away. I found these flamingos in my hometown lake and was fortunate to capture their movements and aggressive calls so perfectly.</p>

                <p>After going to Naguvanahalli near the banks of River Kaveri around Mysore every March - April for Bee Eater photography for many years, it was finally time for me to capture the Blue Tailed Bee-eater’s courtship ritual. It was a Friday morning during the 3rd week of April that I took a trip to Naguvanahalli. It’s never easy to photograph these birds without a hide as these birds get disturbed when anyone closely approaches. I did set up a hide keeping a comfortable distance and ensuring I didn’t disturb their nests. Mounted my Nikon D4 and 500mm lens on a Gitzo tripod connected with Yongnou wireless remote trigger and fixed my camera focus on a perch where most of the activity was happening. As a courtship ritual the male was getting food for its partner and at this point I was able to capture this moment.</p>

                <p>The Bobbit worm is a marine polychaete worm which can have a size of nearly 3 metres in length. The body diameter average at 25mm. Everything about it seem unreal. Rainbow colour body, giant claws, and bizarre behaviour which ambushing prey from underground. It does look both fascinating and scary at the same time. To search for one, you have to scanning through some specific dive site during night dive since they are nocturnal and love to stay at the soft ocean floor. At a one of a divesite in Lembeh Strait, I spend almost 45 minute with this worm. Most of the time is waiting and observe its most natural behaviour. This poor toby fish (Canthigaster sp.) just swim by and give me a scary but special moment. </p>

                <p>Usually, scaly thrush shifts its weight from left to right foot repeatedly to scare the earthworm underground, chasing them outside to capture them. This movement is where the hula originated from. In addition to the hula, this animal demonstrated a new move of spreading its tail feathers to hit the earth's surface. I was able to capture multiple still images of the creature dancing. However, I felt that was not capturing the whole scene, and on the next day, to represent enthusiastic performance, I decided to film the scaly thrush dancing.</p>

				From the daily shootings, I was fascinated by the animals from the Kushiro Marshland, and after the use of numerous frames, I began to frequently use zoom lenses in my work.
				For one cut, I have used a ring blur using the Kenko Mirror Lens, as well as a unique blurred foot representation using the Zeiss Biometar.
				I hope you will enjoy watching this.
				Thank you for your support.

              <div class="gallery__item__block_main__description">
                <p>200km south of Tokyo is an island called "Mikurajima." Near this island, there are over 100 wild bottlenose dolphins living in the water. These dolphins are full of curiosity and will swim together with humans, and if they are interested, they will approach you to play together. I am swimming right next to the dolphin, less than a meter away from myself. If I can't keep up the pace with the dolphin, they will swim back towards me as though they are asking, "Why are you not following me?" As a result, I was able to represent the curiosity and affection towards the human of a parent and a child dolphin. </p>

The theme of this video is whooper swans. They live on a beautiful lake in the dead of winter and are very white and I was grateful to be able to film their elegant appearance. Juvenile swans plumage is a greyish-brown color.
I believe that the reason why people might be fascinated by the beauty of these white shining figures is because they survive the cold winter in northern of Hokkaido. </p>
